Grid map usage stuff

Make a gridmap (x,y,resolution)
Center the map on the rover

while(timesteps)

move map to new rover pos

laserscan -> use to fill in map - callback
	rotate laserscan to local gradient
check planned path for collisions

#something so that it only replans when it got to that waypoint from the last plan or is on the main path
if(collisions)
plan new viable path
end if

end while

time delay before replanning
